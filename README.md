# Surprice_Mirror_Cryptography
"Surprise Mirror Cryptography is a custom text obfuscation technique that reverses letters, replaces digits with symbols, and appends a random special character for added unpredictability. Designed for fun and learning, not for secure encryption."  
Surprise Mirror is a fun, case-sensitive custom cipher that transforms text using:

Letter Reversal (A → z, a → Z, B → y, etc.)
Digit-to-Symbol Mapping (1 → !, 2 → @, etc.)
Random Special Character at the End (for an extra "surprise" effect)
This cipher is not meant for secure encryption but is great for obfuscation, fun projects, and learning cryptography concepts.

Features
✔ Reverses Alphabet Mapping (Case-Sensitive)
✔ Replaces Numbers with Symbols
✔ Adds a Random Special Character
✔ Includes Encryption & Decryption
